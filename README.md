# Django Chat

## The Task

### Implement a chat system:

This task would involve creating a real-time chat system for the application using Django and a web socket library such as Django Channels. The developer would be expected to design the chat interface, handle message sending and receiving, and implement user authentication and authorization for the chat feature.

They may also need to integrate the chat functionality with the rest of the application, such as displaying the chat history on user-specific pages or adding notifications for new messages.

Based on the Django Channels tutorial:
